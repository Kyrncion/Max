# Who Is Max?
Max is a **Typescript-based** Discord bot with many functionalities. He is both my learning curve for understanding [Discord's API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) as well as my current passion project. While he is still in the initial phases of development, I have a lot of plans for him in the future. Max is **not designed** to be self-hosted, and this repository is **not intended** to teach you how to host or run Max locally. *You may use any of my code, with the exception of images, which are prohibited. Please do not advertise Max as your own product.*

## Why Did I Develop Max?
I have always tried to support friends and family members who are dealing with mental health conditions, but as I am aware, I am only one person with limited resources. While I handle most of my communication via Discord, and being aware of the bot development potential Discord offers through their API, I thought I'd put my wits to the test and create a therapeutic hand, or a paw in this case, of Max. A personalized virtual therapy dog. In addition, I wanted to include web development material directly into max so that users could study a specific subject within a subcategory of web development easily.

- [ ] Implement and Explain All CSS3 Principles

## Special Thanks
Thank you to Discord's development team for making the Discord API incredibly accessible, as well as the detailed documentation written to educate developers in the process of developing bots using their API.

Mr. Fast, my website application development instructor, for his guidance and teachings in teaching me and our class the knowledge incorporated into web development and inspiring me to pursue higher education in computer science as well as studying JavaScript in depth.

Most importantly, I want to thank my friends for their encouraging remarks and inspiration to pursue this project, as well as for supplying me with recommendations for bot enhancements and research to accurately feed users accurate information in web development and mental health.

*Thank you for checking out Max; I hope he grows into a bot that can greatly benefit and support users.*
